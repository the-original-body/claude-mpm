Test script to verify the memory file filtering fix works correctly.

This script verifies that:
1. Only *_memories.md files are loaded (not README.md or other docs)
2. PM_memories.md is handled specially
3. Agent memories are only loaded if the agent is deployed
4. Old format files are migrated to new format
