"""
Tests for auto-configure skill deployment integration
===================================================

WHY: Tests skill deployment integration in auto-configure v2, including
agent-skill mapping, cross-scope deployment, and async boundary handling.
Addresses research findings about integration testing over unit testing.

FOCUS: Integration testing with realistic skill deployment scenarios,
testing both success and failure paths across PROJECT/USER scopes.
