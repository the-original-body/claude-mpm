"""Tests for skill deployment tracking and orphan cleanup.

WHY: Ensures deployment tracking index correctly records deployed skills
and cleanup correctly identifies and removes orphaned skills.

DESIGN DECISIONS:
- Test index file creation, loading, and saving
- Test skill tracking and untracking operations
- Test orphan cleanup logic with various scenarios
- Mock file system operations where appropriate
- Validate security constraints (path traversal prevention)
