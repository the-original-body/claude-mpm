"""Test agent deployment to Markdown format.

This script provides basic integration testing for the AgentDeploymentService.
It tests the core deployment functionality by deploying agents to a temporary
directory and verifying the results.

OPERATIONAL PURPOSE:
- Validates deployment pipeline before production releases
- Ensures agent Markdown files are correctly generated
- Verifies deployment service initialization and execution
- Provides quick smoke test for CI/CD pipelines

TEST SCENARIOS COVERED:
1. Service initialization with default paths
2. Agent deployment to a temporary directory with force_rebuild=True
3. Deployment results reporting (total, deployed, updated, migrated, skipped, errors)
4. Markdown file generation and basic validation
5. Sample content verification from deployed files

TEST COVERAGE GAPS:
- No testing of version checking/update logic
- No testing of deployment without force_rebuild
- No testing of migration from old version formats
- No error handling scenarios (missing templates, invalid JSON, etc.)
- No testing of environment variable configuration
- No testing of deployment verification
- No testing of cleanup functionality

DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE INTEGRATION:
1. Run before production deployments
2. Include in CI/CD test suite
3. Monitor execution time (should be < 5 seconds)
4. Check for zero errors in results
5. Verify all expected agents are deployed

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- Template not found: Check src/claude_mpm/agents/templates/
- JSON parse errors: Validate template files with jq
- Missing base agent: Verify base_agent.json exists
- Deployment failures: Check file permissions

    """Test agent deployment.

    This function executes a basic deployment test that:
    1. Creates a temporary directory for deployment
    2. Initializes the deployment service
    3. Deploys all agents with force_rebuild=True
    4. Reports deployment statistics
    5. Lists deployed Markdown files with sizes
    6. Shows sample content from the first deployed agent

    OPERATIONAL METRICS TO MONITOR:
    - Total execution time (target: < 5 seconds)
    - Number of agents deployed (should match template count)
    - Error count (must be 0 for success)
    - File sizes (typical range: 2-5 KB per agent)

    SUCCESS CRITERIA:
    - Zero deployment errors
    - All templates produce Markdown files
    - Markdown files contain valid frontmatter
    - Agent instructions are preserved

    Returns:
        0 on success, non-zero on failure
