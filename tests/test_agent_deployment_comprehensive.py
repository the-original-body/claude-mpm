Comprehensive Agent Deployment Test Suite (TSK-0059)
===================================================

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage for agent deployment scenarios
identified as gaps in the Gemini code review, specifically:

1. Concurrent Agent Deployments
2. Partial Deployment Failures
3. Rollback Scenarios

DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- Tests are deterministic and reproducible
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Use existing test patterns from the codebase
- Include both unit and integration tests
- Add proper assertions for all edge cases

COVERAGE AREAS:
✓ Concurrent deployment race conditions
✓ File system errors during deployment
✓ Permission issues and recovery
✓ Network failure scenarios
✓ Automatic rollback on failure
✓ Manual rollback capability
✓ State consistency verification
✓ Resource contention handling
✓ Lock/mutex verification
✓ Cleanup verification

TEST ARCHITECTURE:
- pytest fixtures for test setup
- Mock patching for controlled failure scenarios
- Threading for concurrent test scenarios
- Temporary directories for isolation
- Comprehensive assertion coverage
