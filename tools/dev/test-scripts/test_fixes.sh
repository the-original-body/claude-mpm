echo "   - Click on any directory node"
echo "   - Should see ALL these effects immediately:"
echo "     a) Node centers in view (smooth 750ms transition)"
echo "     b) Circle grows from 8px to 12px radius"
echo "     c) Blue stroke appears around clicked node"
echo "     d) Parent node gets green stroke"
echo "     e) Orange pulsing starts while loading"

echo "5. Expected behavior summary:"
echo "   - Dotfiles hidden by default (except .gitignore)"
echo "   - All visual feedback works for folders AND files"
echo "   - Effects trigger BEFORE data loading"
