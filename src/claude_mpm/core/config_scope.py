"""Scope-based path resolution for Claude Code deployment directories.

WHY: Centralizes the mapping from configuration scope (project vs user)
to file system paths for agents, skills, and archives. Replaces hardcoded
paths scattered across API handlers.

DESIGN: Pure functions + str-based enum for backward compatibility.
The str base on ConfigScope ensures existing CLI code that compares
against raw "project"/"user" strings continues working unchanged.

NOTE: This module resolves CLAUDE CODE deployment directories (.claude/agents/,
~/.claude/skills/). For MPM configuration directories (.claude-mpm/agents/,
.claude-mpm/behaviors/), see configure_template_editor.py.

class ConfigScope(str, Enum):
    """Storage scope for configuration and deployment paths.

    The str base class ensures backward compatibility with existing
    CLI string comparisons (e.g., scope == "project" still works).

    Scope Semantics:
        PROJECT: All paths are rooted under the project directory.
            - agents:  {project}/.claude/agents/
            - skills:  {project}/.claude/skills/
            - archive: {project}/.claude/agents/unused/
            - config:  {project}/.claude-mpm/

        USER: All paths are rooted under the user home directory.
            - agents:  ~/.claude/agents/
            - skills:  ~/.claude/skills/
            - archive: ~/.claude/agents/unused/
            - config:  ~/.claude-mpm/

    Note:
        The CLI currently defaults to PROJECT scope. Several CLI methods
        (e.g., _deploy_single_agent, _install_skill_from_dict) do NOT
        yet respect the scope setting — they hardcode project_dir or
        Path.cwd() as the deployment target. The resolve_* functions in
        this module provide the CORRECT scope-aware path resolution, but
        callers must be updated to use them.
