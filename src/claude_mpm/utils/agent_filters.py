"""
Agent filtering utilities for claude-mpm.

WHY: This module provides centralized filtering logic to remove non-deployable
agents (BASE_AGENT) and already-deployed agents from user-facing displays.

ARCHITECTURE:
- SOURCE: ~/.claude-mpm/cache/agents/ (git repository cache)
- DEPLOYMENT: .claude/agents/ (project-level deployment location)

DESIGN DECISIONS:
- BASE_AGENT is a build tool, not a deployable agent - filter everywhere
- Deployed agent detection checks .claude/agents/ for all deployed agents
- Supports both virtual (.mpm_deployment_state) and physical (.md files) detection
- Case-insensitive BASE_AGENT detection for robustness
- Pure functions for easy testing and reuse

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Related to ticket 1M-502 Phase 1: UX improvements for agent filtering
- Addresses user confusion from seeing BASE_AGENT and deployed agents in lists

    Design Rationale:
        - Primary detection: Virtual deployment state (.mpm_deployment_state)
        - Fallback detection: Physical .md files in .claude/agents/
        - Returns leaf names for consistent comparison with agent_id formats
        - Combines both detection methods for complete coverage
        - Graceful error handling for malformed or missing state files
        - Only checks project-level deployment (simplified architecture)

    Related:
        - Fixes checkbox interface showing all agents as "○ [Available]" instead of "● [Installed]"
        - Matches detection logic from _is_agent_deployed() in agent_state_manager.py
