  - When no agents have `skills:` frontmatter, zero skills are deployed

  - Now correctly shows count of verified PM skills

## [5.4.58] - 2025-12-30

## [5.4.57] - 2025-12-30

### Changed
- **Skill Deployment**: Move from static mapping to agent frontmatter
  - Each agent now declares skills in frontmatter (`skills:` field)
  - Agents without skills frontmatter get zero skills deployed
  - Deprecated `skill_to_agent_mapping.yaml` - no longer affects deployment

### 🎯 MCP Services Philosophy Change

**Why This Change?**

External MCP services (mcp-vector-search, mcp-browser, kuzu-memory, mcp-ticketer) have matured into standalone projects with their own release cycles and communities. Rather than auto-installing and managing these services from Claude MPM, we now encourage users to install and integrate them directly from their source repositories.

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Users get the latest versions directly from source projects
- ✅ Better separation of concerns (each tool manages its own lifecycle)
- ✅ Reduced complexity in Claude MPM installation
- ✅ More control for users over which services to enable
- ✅ Cleaner dependency management

**Migration Guide**:

If you were relying on auto-installed MCP services, manually install them using pipx:

```bash
# Install optional MCP services as needed
pipx install mcp-vector-search
pipx install mcp-browser
pipx install kuzu-memory
pipx install mcp-ticketer
```

Then configure which services to enable in `.claude-mpm/configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
startup:
  enabled_mcp_services:
    - mcp-vector-search
    - kuzu-memory
    # Add only the services you need
```

### Breaking Changes
- **BREAKING**: Removed MCP service auto-installation from Claude MPM
  - MCP services must now be manually installed via pipx or pip
  - Removed auto-installation prompts and dependency injection logic
  - Services are now user-controlled, not package-managed

### Changed
- **MCP Health Checks**: Now configuration-aware and respect enabled_mcp_services
  - Health checks only run for services listed in enabled_mcp_services config
  - Prevents health check failures for intentionally disabled services
  - Improved user experience by eliminating noise from unused services
- **Logging Verbosity**: Reduced health check logging from INFO to DEBUG level
  - MCP service health checks now log at DEBUG level by default
  - Cleaner startup logs with less noise
  - Only failed checks remain at WARNING/ERROR level for visibility

### Fixed
- **Test Suite**: Fixed 3 test failures from enum consolidation (Batches 21-26)
  - Fixed test_deployment_status_format.py to use OperationResult enum
  - Fixed test_delegation.py to use OperationResult enum
  - Fixed test_session_handlers.py to use ServiceState enum
  - All tests now passing after enum migration cleanup

### Enhanced
- **Project Organizer Agent**: Added PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md support (v1.2.0)
  - Agent now reads and follows PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md standards when present
  - Improved file organization aligned with project-specific conventions
  - Better integration with existing project structure patterns
  - Enhanced documentation awareness for organization tasks

### Security
- **Credential Protection**: Added detect-secrets pre-commit hook
