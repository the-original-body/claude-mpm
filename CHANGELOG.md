  - Performance metrics logging
- **Reorganized service layer into logical domains**
  - `/services/agents/`: Agent discovery, loading, deployment, registry
  - `/services/memory/`: Memory management, routing, optimization, building
  - `/services/tickets/`: Ticket creation, tracking, state management
  - `/services/hooks/`: Hook registration, execution, validation

### 📈 Performance Enhancements

  - Lazy loading of heavy dependencies
  - Parallel initialization where possible
  - Caching of expensive computations
- **Agent deployment optimized with parallel loading**
  - Concurrent file operations for agent deployment
  - Batch processing for multiple agents
  - Progress tracking with real-time updates
- **Memory queries optimized with indexing** (O(n) to O(log n))
  - B-tree indexing for memory lookups
  - Caching of frequently accessed memories
  - Efficient memory routing algorithms
- **File operations reduced by 50-70% through caching**
  - In-memory caching of configuration files

### 🔄 Breaking Changes
- **Service interfaces moved to `services/core/interfaces.py`**
  - Update imports: `from claude_mpm.services.core.interfaces import IAgentService`
  - All service contracts now in central location
  - Cleaner separation of interface and implementation
- **Some import paths changed due to service reorganization**
  - Agent services: `services/agent_*` → `services/agents/*`
  - Memory services: `services/memory_*` → `services/memory/*`
  - See MIGRATION.md for complete list
- **Configuration structure updated**
  - New hierarchical configuration format
  - Environment-specific overrides
  - Validation of configuration values

### 📋 Migration Guide

To upgrade from 3.7.x to 3.8.0:

1. **Update import paths** for services:
   ```python
   # Old
   from claude_mpm.services.agent_registry import AgentRegistry
   
   # New
   from claude_mpm.services.agents.agent_registry import AgentRegistry
   ```

2. **Update configuration files** to new format:
   ```yaml
   # Old format
   timeout: 30
   
   # New format
   timeouts:
     default: 30
     agent_deployment: 60
   ```

3. **Review breaking changes** in service interfaces
4. **Run tests** to ensure compatibility
5. **Update any custom services** to use new DI patterns

See [MIGRATION.md](docs/MIGRATION.md) for detailed upgrade instructions.
