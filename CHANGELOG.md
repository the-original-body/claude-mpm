## [3.6.0] - 2025-08-12

### Executive Summary

Claude MPM 3.6.0 introduces **three major architectural improvements** that significantly enhance performance, maintainability, and developer experience:

1. **Dynamic Agent Dependencies** - Smart dependency loading that only checks and installs packages for deployed agents, reducing installation size by up to 90%
2. **Enhanced PM Instructions** - Separation of framework requirements from customizable PM instructions with structured response formats
3. **Improved Agent Deployment** - State tracking, dependency caching, and better deployment verification with comprehensive audit tools

### New Agents

#### Code Analyzer Agent
- **Advanced AST-powered code analysis**: New specialized agent for comprehensive code quality assessment
- **Multi-language support**: Uses tree-sitter for cross-language analysis and Python's native ast module for Python-specific analysis
- **Pattern detection**: Identifies code quality issues, security vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks
- **Structural analysis**: Detects god objects/functions, circular dependencies, code duplication, and architectural issues
- **Security scanning**: Finds hardcoded secrets, SQL injection risks, command injection, unsafe deserialization
- **Quality metrics**: Measures complexity, coupling, cohesion with configurable thresholds
- **Dependencies**: Requires tree-sitter>=0.21.0 and tree-sitter-language-pack>=0.8.0 (auto-managed via dynamic dependency system)
- **Dynamic analysis**: Creates on-the-fly analysis scripts for specific codebase needs
- **Actionable reporting**: Provides prioritized findings with specific file:line references and remediation examples

### Major Features

#### Dynamic Agent Dependencies System
- **90% smaller installations**: Core installation ~50 MB vs ~500 MB with all dependencies
- **Faster startup**: No need to load unused dependencies, cached checks per session
- **Better compatibility**: Avoid version conflicts from unused agents
- **Environment awareness**: Python 3.13 compatibility checking with helpful warnings
- New commands:
  - `claude-mpm agents deps-check` - Check dependencies for deployed agents
  - `claude-mpm agents deps-install` - Install missing dependencies automatically
  - `claude-mpm agents deps-list --format pip` - Export dependencies

#### Enhanced PM Instructions Architecture
- Separation of non-negotiable framework requirements (BASE_PM.md) from customizable instructions (INSTRUCTIONS.md)
- Template variable injection for dynamic context ({{current-date}}, {{agent-capabilities}})
- Structured JSON response format for better logging and tracking
- TodoWrite prefix rules for clear agent delegation patterns

#### Improved Agent Deployment System
- Enhanced deployment workflow with state tracking and verification
- New audit script `scripts/audit_documentation.py` for comprehensive documentation analysis
- Deployment state persistence in `.claude/agents/.mpm_deployment_state`
- Dependency cache with intelligent invalidation in `.claude/agents/.dependency_cache`

### Performance Enhancements
- **Startup Performance**: Only check deployed agents with intelligent caching
- **Installation Size**: Core ~50 MB (was ~500 MB with all dependencies)
- **Caching Improvements**: 24-hour TTL with deployment hash-based invalidation

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed duplication issues in agent deployment process
- Resolved path resolution problems in `.claude/agents/` directory
- Fixed configuration file validation edge cases
- Enhanced agent memory routing with clearer error messages
- Resolved hook integration issues causing missed responses

### Migration Guide
- Version 3.6.0 is fully backward compatible
- After upgrade, run `claude-mpm agents deps-check` to verify dependencies
- Run `claude-mpm agents deps-install` to install only required dependencies
- Optionally update configuration for enhanced logging (debug mode now default)

### Technical Details
- New files: `agent_dependency_loader.py`, `dependency_cache.py`, `dependency_strategies.py`, `environment_context.py`
- New documentation: `docs/DYNAMIC_DEPENDENCIES.md`, `docs/developer/02-core-components/pm-architecture.md`
- Enhanced response logging with default debug mode
- Smart dependency checking with three-phase approach: Discovery → Resolution → Verification
